# Layout

## Main code
The main code is split into four folders:
`audio/`, `graphics/`, `networking/`, `pages/`, and `misc/`.
Each of these folders have subfolders of `components/` and `utils/`
which contain React components and functionality code, respectively.
* `audio/` contains code related to Tone.js and other audio stuff.
* `graphics/` contains GLSL code and anything else pretty the user will see
* `networking/` contains code for the Peer.js client
* `pages/` contains code related to 
* `misc/` contains code for other components and tools that don't fit rigidly
   into the above categories, but may someday have its own category

## Extra code
* `resources/` contains any media that is used inside of the code.
* `tests/` contains tests for the code.
* `styles/` contains CSS for the components.
